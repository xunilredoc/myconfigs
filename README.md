######	> .config/i3: personal optimizations & styling  
My personalized config files for use with i3-gaps. The content provided includes 'like' (similar, not exact due to security reason) copies of various config files for those seeking to:

1. copy my i3-gaps setup
2. check something out / see how it was done
3. offer suggestions, feedback, critizism, or hatemail
4. find amusement in my poor and limited coding abilities
5. print & frame (or burn, your choice!) 


####	> .config/nvim 
NeoVim config for minimalists. The config will produce a bloatfree installation of NeoVim providing a few hand--selected plugins. Enjoy
